# For a game of Dungeons & Dragons, each player starts by
# generating a character they can play with.

# This character has, among other things, six abilities:
#    strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma.

# These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly.

# You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and
# record the sum of the largest three dice.

# You do this six times, once for each ability.

# Your character's initial hitpoints are
# 10 + your character's constitution modifier.

# You find your character's constitution modifier by
# subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.
